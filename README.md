# Processing_SpaceScene

3D scene showing Earth with 3 texture layers with animated rotating. 
Light starts of animating until colour is changed by user.
Rotating 'Skybox'
Object orientated practices used (Interfaces, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism etc).
Variety of keyboard controls present. (Quit, Enable wireframes, change light colour, move light).

Classes were grouped into similarly named files, I had way to many classes for Processing to show the tabs correctly.
